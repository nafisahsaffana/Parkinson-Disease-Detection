# Context
Parkinson's disease is a chronic degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that primarily impacts the motor system. The manifestation of symptoms typically occurs gradually and, as the disease progresses, non-motor symptoms tend to become more prevalent. Additionally, depression and anxiety frequently coexist, affecting over a third of individuals with PD. 

Parkinson’s disease cannot be cured, but early detection and medication can improve symptoms and quality of life. A study found that drawing speed and pen pressure differed in Parkinson’s patients. Tremors and muscle rigidity affect the visual appearance of a hand-drawn spiral. I use this variation to train a computer algorithm to detect Parkinson’s disease.
